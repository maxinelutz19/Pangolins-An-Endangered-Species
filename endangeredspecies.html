						<h3>A Fun Sized Animal!</h3>
							<p>The pangolin, though most people think it is a reptile, is one of the smallest 
							mammals that we can know of. It can weigh anywhere between <b>4 to 4.7 pounds</b>. 
							They are nocturnal animals who roll into the ball when they are grabbed and their 
							sharp scales on the tail can be used to lash out at whatever attacks it. They eat ants,
							termites, and larvae. There are eight species of the animal, four in Asia and four in Africa. 
							The species in Asia are the Indian pangolin, the Philippine pangolin, the Sunda pangolin, and the Chinese pangolin. 
							The species in Africa are the Black-bellied pangolin, the White-bellied pangolin, Giant Ground 
							pangolin, and the Temminck's Ground pangolin. Because they are are critically endangered, 
							the species are protected under national and international laws.</p>
						
						<h3>The Most Trafficked Mammal in the World</h3>
							<p>The most desirable things about the pangolins for trade and barter are their scales, which 
							are useful for medicine and remedies, and their meat, which is considered a delicacy. 
							They are in high demand in countries like China and Vietnam. Though there are many laws against
							the killing of pangolins and the selling of their meat and scales, there was an estimated
							<b>166,990-233,980 pangolins killed </b>between 2011 and 2013. In addition to the pangolins being 
							hunted excessively, their habitat is also being threatened by humans. They live in grasslands
							and forests, but those areas are being harmed by the use of pesticides and electric fences.
							Conservationists worry that the pangolins are being especially targeted by poachers on the Asian
							markets.</p>

						<h3>How Are Humans Helping?</h3>
							<p class="p1">In 2016, over 150 governments signed a treaty that announced the agreement that would
							later end all illegal trade of anything with pangolins. It protected the rest of the species
							from becoming endangered again in the future, but of course, illegal trade still happens. 
							The WWF and TRAFFIC are trying to help the species and enforce the laws placed so that 
							they can protect the species from wildlife crime. Anyone who logs into the World Wildlife website
							is able to join the "Stop Wildlife Crime Campaign" and help enforce the laws put in place. If we
							work together, not only with just those in the United States, but with those in other nations,
							then us humans may actually be able to stop the endangerment of the pangolins and save their lives!</p>
